# Pseudo Code Solution

Function that takes a number/iterations as an argument (we will use 100).
Outputs an array of numbers.


For loop
The iteration starts at 0, where there is no previous number. If the output array has a length of zero, then push the current number to the outputArray.

In every iteration moving forward:
Take the previous number in the array and add it to the current number. Push this to the array.
