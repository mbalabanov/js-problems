# Plain English Solution

Create a function that takes a string and returns a string.

In the function the original string is split into an array by the space character. Initialize an empty piglatin string in preparation for the output.

Iterate through each word in the new array and take out the first character into a seperate variable and add it to the end of the word, add also "ay" to the end of the word. Append the word to the piglatin string (include a space if it is not the last word).

Return the piglatin string.
