# Pseudo Code Solution

Create an array with the coinDenominations [100, 25, 10, 5, 1]

Create a function that takes a totalMoneyCount and outputs a string of coinDenominations and their count.

Iterate through the array of coinDenominations and if the current coinDenomination is smaller than the totalMoneyCount left.

If smaller, then check remainder of totalMoneyCount and the current coinDenominations.

Subtract the current coinDenomination
